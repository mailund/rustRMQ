//! The log functions in this module requires that the index is at least 1
//! since log(0) is not well-defined. This works out well, though, since we
//! use them for j in intervals [i,j) where j > i, so j >= 1. For allocating
//! memory for tables that address in log-space, however, it means that
//! if you want to index k (j == 2^k+jj) you need at least k entries, so
//! you cannot use log2_up when j is a power of two (log2_up(2^k) == k)
//! as this will be one too little. To allocate memory, use log_table_size(j)
//! which will be log2_down(j) + 1. When j is not a power of two, this is
//! the same as log2_up(j), but for powers of two, it adds the extra entry.
